(Every tasks in CTF im doing on my virtual lab in kali Linux.) (Python coding in VSC)

Simple Programming 30 points Easy

Task description: "Can you help me? I need to know how many lines there are where the number of 0's is a multiple of 3 or the numbers of 1s is a multiple of 2. Please! Here is the file: https://mega.nz/#!7aoVEKhK!BAohJ0tfnP7bISIkbADK3qe1yNEkzjHXLKoJoKmqLys "

1. First of all: code writing 
def count_valid_rows_from_file(filename):
    count = 0

    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        for line in file: 
            line = line.strip()  # Usuwamy białe znaki (np. \n)
            zeros = line.count('0')
            ones = line.count('1')

            if zeros % 3 == 0 or ones % 2 == 0:
                count += 1

    return count

filename = "data.dat"  # nazwa pliku podanego w zadaniu
result = count_valid_rows_from_file(filename)
print(f"Liczba pasujących wierszy: {result}")

2. File contains a sequence of different numbers.
3. After use code the flag show is: "CTFlearn{6662}"

In this CTF author ask u to count his sequence of numbers with simple coding in python.
