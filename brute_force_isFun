Task description: You'll need Brute Force to solve this. Knowing Python should help too. Oh! And Base64 encryption of course! Find the flag!

1. From creator of this CTF we got normal image(jpeg) 
2. I used command binwalk to see what is inside after i saw there is many folders and zip.
3. So i use command binwalk -e (extract) to get a extracted hidden in image files.
4. At all we found in folders hint in that form ("Hmmm... almost!
The password is: "ctflag*****" where * is a number.
Encrypt the password using MD5 and compare it to the given hash!
As I said, you're gonna have to brute force the password!
Good luck! :)")
5. So i need to write a python code using methot brute force
6. First part of code: 
def Brute():
    for i in range(0, 100000):
      print(f'ctflag{i}')

Brute()
  (generate from 00000 to 99999 every options)

7. After all my try code by myself and help with AI im fail  after all i found ready script in internet: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69763941/how-do-i-brute-force-a-password-protected-zip-file-with-a-three-digit-password
I need change some detail to figure out what i need from task code:
import zipfile
import itertools

digits = '0123456789'

for c in itertools.product(digits, repeat=5):
  password = 'ctflag'+ ''.join(c)
  try:
    with zipfile.ZipFile('1926.zip', 'r') as zip_ref:
      zip_ref.extractall(path='/tmp', pwd = bytes(password, 'utf-8'))
      print(f"Found correct password {password}")
      break
  except:
    print('Password ' + password + ' failed')
It can be optimalize but was too hard for me at this time i should something to make process faster.
after long brute force i found a flag which was "ctflag
next step is encrypt next zip with hashes which we got in task:
